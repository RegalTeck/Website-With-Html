Creating my first website with html. i used sementic tags like header, nav, section and footer. 
I also used links, images and videos to make it more interactive.
I created the following pages HOME, ABOUT, WORK, RESUME, CONTACT, SIGN UP and REGISTRATION page. 
All the pages are linked together.
The logo button on clcik willredirect to home page.
It's an interesting journey so far.
