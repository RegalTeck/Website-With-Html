Creating my first website with html. i used sementic tags like header, nav, section and footer. <br>
I also used links, images and videos to make it more interactive. <br>
I created the following pages HOME, ABOUT, WORK, RESUME, CONTACT, SIGN UP and REGISTRATION page. <br>
All the pages are linked together.<br>
The logo button on clcik willredirect to home page. <br><br><br>
It's an interesting journey so far.<br>
